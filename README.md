# Machine Learning Engineer Basics
 This repository explain the differences between data science and machine learning engineer positions. It also explains the basic knowledge of machine learning engineering.

# Difference between machine learning engineer role and data science role
The two positions quite overlaping depending on the company. In small companies, data scientist might also do some machine learning engineering roles but in big companies they are separated roles.

There are some common skills in both roles such as general knowledge of machine learning algorithms, predictive modeling, math and statistics, and python libraries.

However, the main skills for data scientists include data story telling (data exploratory analysis), domain knowledge about the business, data collection, data cleaning and exploration, building models and collecting insights.

The main skills for the machine learning engineers include skills related to core software engineers, data structure and algorithms, computer science background, understanding of memory and CPU utilization, distributed computing, fault tolerance, log analysis, developing specific machine learning models, and doing machine learning and deep learning all the time.
